# Python Functional Programs

This repository contains a collection of Python programs that perform different practical tasks or utility functions.  

The main idea is to demonstrate how to build functional and reusable programs by applying concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and the **SOLID principles**, ensuring a clean, maintainable, and scalable design.  

Each program can be executed as a standalone Python script and can also be packaged into an executable (.exe) so it can run without requiring Python installation.  

## Repository Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a specific program.
- Inside each folder you will find:
  - The Python source code.
  - A `README.md` explaining the program in detail.
  - (Optional) The `.exe` version.

## Goals

This project aims to:
- Practice and apply software development best practices in Python.
- Create functional tools to solve common tasks.
- Show how programs can evolve from simple scripts into standalone executables.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- Specific dependencies listed in each folder.
